# System
These macros are specifically meant to be used with the [Mythras](https://gitlab.com/kp-systems/mythras) system. Some may find these to be heaven-sent, while others may find them to be totally useless or unnecessary.

## Macros List
- Reset AP for selected tokens
- Reset Luck Points for all players
- Upgrade Skill
- Manage Currency
    - May require some tweaking if your currencies do not have unique icons.
- Randomize Build
    - May require tweaking stat/skill randomization based on your preferences. Duplicate macros may need to be created for different species of enemies.
- Add Armour
    - Will require updating the Armour List Codes array with your armour IDs. Looks in world.armour by default - may require tweaking.
- Attack
    - Derivation of DogBoneZone's All-In-One Combat Action macro with slight tweaks and compatibility with v12.
